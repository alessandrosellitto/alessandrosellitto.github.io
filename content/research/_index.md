  **Abstract:**
  This paper studies the welfare trade-offs of data integration in digital platform markets using a model with heterogeneous privacy sensitivity, personalization preferences, and endogenous platform investment. Lowering opt-out costs improves welfare by allowing privacy-sensitive users to limit data use while preserving service quality and advertising efficiency. Structural restrictions on data integration, including caps and data siloing, increase welfare only when privacy costs outweigh quality and advertising gains. Data sharing requirements have context-dependent effects through competition and investment incentives. The framework clarifies when consumer choice dominates structural intervention in data-driven digital markets.
